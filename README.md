## 🔍 Description
This repository contains another homework assignment conducted through the teaching facilities of the Univesity of Birmingham, in the Coding Bootcamp. It contains a software application by the name "Employee Tracker", used for the very purpose as suggested in the name. This app is specifically designed for business/company owners who wish to keep track of their employees working in under different roles and different departments. It allows the user to perform the following activities, by presenting the user a series of prompts and depending upon the user's response (whereby a manager is also categorised as an employee in this application):

- View employees, roles, departments, and/or managers
- Add employees, roles, departments, and/or managers
- Update employee role and/or employee manager
- Delete employees, roles, and/or departments
