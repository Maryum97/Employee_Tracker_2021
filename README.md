## 🔍 Description
This repository contains another homework assignment conducted through the teaching facilities of the Univesity of Birmingham, in the Coding Bootcamp. It contains a software application by the name "Employee Tracker", used for the very purpose as suggested in the name. This app is specifically designed for business/company owners who wish to keep track of their employees working in under different roles and different departments. It allows the user to perform the following activities, by presenting the user a series of prompts and depending upon the user's response (whereby a manager is also categorised as an employee in this application):

- View employees, roles, departments, and/or managers
- Add employees, roles, departments, and/or managers
- Update employee role and/or employee manager
- Delete employees, roles, and/or departments

## 💾 Installation
In order to install this app, the user must have all of the following installed and running on their local machines successfully:

1. Git bash (or terminal), to pull this app from Github
2. Visual Studio Code (VSC), to view the code
3. Node.js, to run the commands and inquirer prompts
4. MySQL Workbench, to run the database
5. XAMPP Control Panel, if user uses Windows, to 'Start' MySQL to connect in the Node terminal

After having set up all of the above, install the following packages and dependancies:

1. package.json (for node modules):
    > npm install
2. mysql2, to achieve connection with the SQL database in JavaScript:
    > npm install mysql2
3. inquirer, to prompt user questions in node
    > npm install inquirer
4. console.table, to view databases in node
    > npm install console.table

Now the user is able to make use of this application without any obstacles!

## ⚙️ Instructions
After pursuing all of the downloads and installations above, the user must follow the instructions listed below:

1. Open VSC
2. Open the terminal
3. Run the following command in the terminal:
    > npm start
4. A menu of prompts appears in the terminal. Choose any of the prompts to fulfil any of the requirements of the company (as listed in the repository description above)
5. Once finished using the app, press 'CTRL + C' to kill the server. If the server asks if you want to 'Terminate batch job (Y/N)', type in 'Y', as in, 'yes', otherwise 'N', for 'no'.

The user must beware of one thing: if they return an empty value for any input, the table returns empty at that instance of the added value, which may be problematic to read and understand as a database value! So they must make sure to ALWAYS provide an appropriate, legible value to all inputs!

<i>EXAMPLE:</i>

1. From the prompts, select: 'View All Employees By Role'
2. Then select: 'Update Employee Role'
3. Choose the targeted employee's last name, and assign them a new role
4. Select 'Update Employee Role' again, and now look at the updated role of the employee!

## 💻 Usage
Watch the video in the description above and read the instructions, in order to make correct use of the app. Feel free to use it at all times, after ensuring that the 'npm start' command is running in the server.

## ✏️ Tests
There were no particular test that this app has been made to pass, except for the app to flow error-free in the local terminal, with all the correct packages and libraries installed, the script connected with MySQL through node, and all the inquirer prompts running correctly in the terminal. Once all the requirements have been met, this app is now ready for use!
